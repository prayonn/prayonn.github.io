<p>For most creatures, spring means more warmth and more daylight, and these two elements have major effects on animal behavior. Why Spring Activity? Animals become active in spring—arising from winter sleep, migrating, breeding—because, with the warmth, plants grow and food becomes more abundant</p>

<h3> <id="what makes spring nice">what makes spring nice</h3>
<p>Temperatures Become More Pleasant: During Spring the axis of the Earth is at an angle in between our closest and furthest point from the sun. The temperatures become more moderate and people can say goodbye to the frigid cold of Winter and enjoy the transition before a hot Summer kicks in</p>

<h3> <id="what are springs key colour and why those colours">what are springs key colour and why those colours</h3>
<p>True Spring's best colours are usually warm greens, yellows, orangey reds, very peachy pinks and every shade of light brown from tan to palest beige. This is the softest and lightest of the Spring colours - the intensity and saturation of those bolder Spring colours is really dialled down</p>

<h3> <id="what springs weather like">what springs weather like</h3>
<p>Spring is the time of year when many things change—including the weather. Temperatures can swing back and forth between balmy and frigid. Sunny days may be followed by a week of stormy weather. Sometimes extreme weather changes can occur even within the same day</p>
