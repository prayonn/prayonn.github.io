<h3>Winter is good for the world around us. Many plants need shorter days and low temperatures to become dormant. This way plants can store up energy for new growth. If a fruit tree doesn't have enough chilling time, it will produce fewer, weaker buds</h3>

<h3> what is winter like</h3>
<p>The winter season brings a variety of adverse weather extremes. You may experience heavy snow, ice accumulation, freezing temperatures and wind chill. Winter storms are often called the "deceptive killers" since many deaths can be attributed to indirect causes of adverse weather</p>

<h3> which animals hibernate in winter and why</h3>
<p>An animal will hibernate when the food supply runs low and the temperatures drop, causing it to be too cold to wander about.
Chipmunks.
Bears.
Bats.
Box Turtles.
Bumblebees.
Garter Snake.
Hedgehog.
Land Snail.</p>

<h3> why people like winter</h3>
<p>Cold weather brings people together, we yearn for warmth, love, and connection. The holidays deliver big family meals, endless gratitude, and it just seems like time moves a little bit slower than usual. When the first winter breeze blows through the trees you can feel the magic in the air</p>

<h3>what causes the cold weather in winter</h3>
<p>During the winter, the sun's rays hit the Earth at a shallow angle. These rays are more spread out, which minimizes the amount of energy that hits any given spot. Also, the long nights and short days prevent the Earth from warming up. Thus, we have winter</p>
